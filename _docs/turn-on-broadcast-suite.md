## BEFORE YOU BEGIN

## STEP 2: Turn the Room On

## STEP 3: Power On the Cameras
- Go to the **server room**
- Locate the **server rack on the right**
- On the rack:
  - Turn on the **power switches for all four cameras**
  - Power them on **one at a time**, if possible

## STEP 4: Verify Camera Status
- Return to the Broadcast Suite
- Confirm:
  - All four cameras appear in the system
  - Video feeds are active
  - No error or warning indicators are present

## IMPORTANT NOTES
