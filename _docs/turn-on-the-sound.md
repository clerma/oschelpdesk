This article outlines the proper steps for **powering on the audio system** in the Main Sanctuary.
Following this order helps protect equipment and prevents unwanted noise during startup.

---

## BEFORE YOU BEGIN
- Ensure the room has already been powered on
- Keep all main outputs muted during startup
- If anything looks or sounds abnormal, stop and notify a **Production Lead**

---

## STEP 1: Power On the Sound Board
- Turn on the **sound board**
- Allow the board to fully boot before touching any controls
- Do not unmute channels yet

---

## STEP 2: Load the Correct Scene or Snapshot
- Once the board has finished booting:
  - Load the appropriate **service scene, snapshot, or show file**
- Verify:
  - Channel names appear correctly
  - Routing and sends look normal
  - Master output remains muted

---

## STEP 3: Power On the Audio Rack
- Locate the **audio rack** (processors, wireless units, etc.)
- Power on any required audio equipment
- Allow devices a few seconds each to fully initialize

---

## STEP 4: Power On Amplifiers
- Turn on amplifiers **last**
- Power amps on **one at a time**
- Watch for:
  - Fault lights
  - Error indicators
  - Unusual noises

---

## STEP 5: Check Inputs
- Confirm the following inputs are present:
  - Pastor microphone
  - Worship microphones
  - Playback/computer audio
- Leave channels muted until sound check begins

---

## STEP 6: Unmute When Ready
- When instructed by a Production Lead:
  - Unmute necessary channels
  - Bring faders up slowly
- Listen carefully for:
  - Pops
  - Buzzing
  - Feedback

---

## IMPORTANT NOTES
- Always power audio **on in this order**:
  1. Sound board
  2. Audio rack equipment
  3. Amplifiers
- Never power amplifiers on first
- If audio behaves unexpectedly, mute outputs immediately
