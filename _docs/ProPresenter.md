# Using ProPresenter for Sunday Services

This article walks through the basic workflow for running ProPresenter during a Sunday service at Our Savior’s Church.
It is intended for production volunteers and team leads serving on lyrics or media.

## Before Service Begins

Arrive early enough to power on the presentation computer and verify all required equipment is functioning properly.
Ensure displays, projectors, and confidence monitors are turned on and receiving signal.

- Open ProPresenter
- Confirm the correct output screens are active
- Verify audio playback levels if media is included

## Loading the Service Presentation

Each service should already have a prepared presentation loaded or saved in the appropriate playlist.
If not, locate the correct presentation from the library.

- Select the correct service date
- Confirm lyrics and slides match the order of worship
- Check for missing media or formatting issues

## During Worship

During worship, advance slides smoothly and intentionally.
Stay attentive to the worship leader and be prepared for spontaneous repeats or transitions.

- Follow the worship leader closely
- Do not rush slides ahead of the congregation
- Be ready to loop or repeat sections if needed

## Sermon Slides & Media

Sermon slides may include scripture, points, or media clips.
Be alert for cues from the teaching pastor or production director.

- Advance slides only when prompted
- Verify scripture references are correct
- Play videos only after confirming audio levels

## Common Issues & Tips

If something goes wrong, stay calm and communicate with the production lead.
Many issues can be resolved quickly without disrupting service.

- If slides freeze, pause before clicking repeatedly
- If text is incorrect, notify a team lead immediately
- If audio fails, mute playback and alert the audio team

## After Service

Once service concludes, clear the active presentation and prepare the system for the next service if applicable.

- Close or reset the presentation
- Do not shut down unless instructed
- Report any issues encountered during service
