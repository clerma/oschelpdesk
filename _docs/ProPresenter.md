      <h1>Using ProPresenter for Sunday Services</h1>
      <p>
        This article walks through the basic workflow for running ProPresenter during a Sunday service at Our Savior’s Church.
        It is intended for production volunteers and team leads serving on lyrics or media.
      </p>

    <h4 class="c_head load-order-2">Before Service Begins</h4>
    <p>
      Arrive early enough to power on the presentation computer and verify all required equipment is functioning properly.
      Ensure displays, projectors, and confidence monitors are turned on and receiving signal.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-unstyled">
      <li>Open ProPresenter</li>
      <li>Confirm the correct output screens are active</li>
      <li>Verify audio playback levels if media is included</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="c_head load-order-2">Loading the Service Presentation</h4>
    <p>
      Each service should already have a prepared presentation loaded or saved in the appropriate playlist.
      If not, locate the correct presentation from the library.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-unstyled">
      <li>Select the correct service date</li>
      <li>Confirm lyrics and slides match the order of worship</li>
      <li>Check for missing media or formatting issues</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="c_head load-order-2">During Worship</h4>
    <p>
      During worship, advance slides smoothly and intentionally.
      Stay attentive to the worship leader and be prepared for spontaneous repeats or transitions.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-unstyled">
      <li>Follow the worship leader closely</li>
      <li>Do not rush slides ahead of the congregation</li>
      <li>Be ready to loop or repeat sections if needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="c_head load-order-2">Sermon Slides & Media</h4>
    <p>
      Sermon slides may include scripture, points, or media clips.
      Be alert for cues from the teaching pastor or production director.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-unstyled">
      <li>Advance slides only when prompted</li>
      <li>Verify scripture references are correct</li>
      <li>Play videos only after confirming audio levels</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="c_head load-order-2">Common Issues & Tips</h4>
    <p>
      If something goes wrong, stay calm and communicate with the production lead.
      Many issues can be resolved quickly without disrupting service.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-unstyled">
      <li>If slides freeze, pause before clicking repeatedly</li>
      <li>If text is incorrect, notify a team lead immediately</li>
      <li>If audio fails, mute playback and alert audio team</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="c_head load-order-2">After Service</h4>
    <p>
      Once service concludes, clear the active presentation and prepare the system for the next service if applicable.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-unstyled">
      <li>Close or reset the presentation</li>
      <li>Do not shut down unless instructed</li>
      <li>Report any issues encountered during service</li>
    </ul>
