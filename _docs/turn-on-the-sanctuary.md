This article outlines the **standard process for powering on the Main Sanctuary** before a service.
Follow the steps in order to ensure audio, lighting, and video systems start correctly.

---

## BEFORE YOU BEGIN
- Arrive with enough time to complete setup calmly
- Do not rush power-up steps
- If something does not respond as expected, pause and ask a **Production Lead**

---

## STEP 1: Power On the Room
- Use the **room control system or wall-mounted controller** to turn the sanctuary on
- Confirm:
  - Stage lights begin to come up
  - Screens and monitors receive signal
  - System indicators begin to respond

---

## STEP 2: Sound Board
- Power on the **sound board**
- Allow the board to fully boot before touching any controls
- Load the appropriate **service scene or snapshot** if applicable
- Verify:
  - Main outputs are muted initially
  - Faders are in expected starting positions

---

## STEP 3: Amplifiers & Audio Rack
- Locate the **amp rack**
- Power on amplifiers **after** the sound board is fully on
- Turn amps on **one at a time**, allowing a few seconds between each
- Confirm no warning or fault lights appear

---

## STEP 4: Lighting Console
- Power on the **lighting console**
- Allow the console to fully boot
- Load the default **pre-service lighting look**
- Confirm:
  - House lights respond correctly
  - Stage lighting is active
  - No error messages are displayed

---

## STEP 5: Video & Screens
- Confirm:
  - Projectors or LED walls are powered on
  - Stage displays and confidence monitors are active
- If needed, power on screens using the appropriate remote or control panel
- Verify signal is present before service begins

---

## STEP 6: Final Audio Check
- Unmute main outputs when ready
- Perform a brief audio check:
  - Microphones
  - Playback audio
  - Walk-on music if applicable
- Make small adjustments only — major changes should be handled by a Production Lead

---

## IMPORTANT NOTES
- Always power equipment **on in this order**:
  1. Control systems
  2. Sound board
  3. Amplifiers
  4. Lighting console
  5. Video systems
- Never power amps on before the sound board
- If something feels off, **stop and ask**
